# robofind

A robot manipulator is a movable chain of links interconnected by joints. One end is fixed to the ground, and a hand or end effector that can move freely in space is attached at the other end.

This Matlab code solves the problem where an obstacle exist in the path of a robotic manipulator. When the robotic arm is given a task to move its end between two points in the kinematic space.

Choose start and end points in the Matlab code to try.
